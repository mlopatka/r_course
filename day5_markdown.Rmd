# standard linear equation
# nested data: 2 levels of nesting
# smallest unit of analysis.

# Fixed Effects: the effect applies equally to all participants, therefore the slope must be equal, but the intercept will be flexible.
# Random Effects: the effect will differe for each individual in the population.
# Mixed effects both fixed, and random

# level 1 prediction
# Y_i,j = growth + error
# Y_ij = n_0i + n_1iX_ij + e+ij

# level 2 prediction
# n_0i = Y_00 + g_0i
# Y_00 is the mean initial status or popuation avergae for all intercepts pertaining to one individual
# g_0i is the level 2 random effect of initial status (intercept) error term for individuals fromt he group mean.

# random intercepts fixed slopes (mean of the slopes for all groups = y_00)
# discrepancy between each indivdual and the mean (y_00) is the 

# random slopes are inputed into g_1i
# mean of slopes should be ~0
# indivisual slopes for one person lead to an individual's random effect 
# which will be different per individual (difference in global slope and individual group slope)
```

mdl1 <- lmer(longDat$depsev~1+(1|longDat$ID),data=longDat)
# ID is the individual, so this is the nesting (level 2) variable
# depSev = the thing to be observed
# (Intercept)  5.07786  corresponds to the average Time 0 depresion level for the entire population!

# 0.7021/(0.7021+1.2218) corresponds to the intraclass correlation coefficient
